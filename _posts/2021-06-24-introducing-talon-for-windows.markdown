### Introduction

After half a year since it was [first teased](https://twitter.com/peroxaan/status/1339993942469832705?s=21), Talon for Windows is finally available! Talon for Windows requires Windows 7 or newer - and does indeed work well on the unreleased (at the time of writing) Windows 11. You can download it [here](https://downloads.peroxaan.com/TalonWin/TalonSetup.exe).

### Design

Talon for Windows matches the design scheme of Windows quite well in our opinion, and we think it'll fit right in with everything else. [Iris](https://twitter.com/TheLBall) did great work here. Check out the official unveil video:
