Today, Peroxaan is introducing a new logo - with a refreshed gradient, and a more rounded icon design. It also brings back the text from one of our older logos.

We hope you like this new logo! It was designed by [Dylan](https://twitter.com/DylanMcD8) - massive thanks to him.

I'm certainly a big fan of it. You'll be seeing this new logo roll out in Peroxaan branding over the next few days.

Thank you for your support! See you soon.
