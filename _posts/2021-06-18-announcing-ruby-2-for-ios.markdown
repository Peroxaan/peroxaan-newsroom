We're happy to announce that Ruby 2.0 is coming, built for iOS 15, watchOS 8, and macOS Monterey. This is the first of many announcements we'll make based on the new technologies unveiled at WWDC21.

### Public TestFlight
First and foremost, we're going to be opening Ruby's public TestFlight for the first time in nearly a year - to give people the opportunity to try out Ruby 2.0 early, for free. For now, the TestFlight link will only contain a build of Ruby v1.3 - which introduces the SF Rounded design that we previously teased. However, we're going all in on v2.0 - so expect builds soon.

### What to expect
Our plan is to rebuild Ruby with SwiftUI 3.0 to take advantage of the new components introduced at WWDC21. Expect a lot of Mac App improvements, and big changes to the iPad app. Ruby 2.0 will be a much more refined version of the News app you already knew.

### Whats new in SwiftUI 3.0?
SwiftUI 3.0 adds a lot of things natively to SwiftUI that previously had to be imported using third party libraries. This includes search bars, pull to refresh, etc. With SwiftUI 3.0 - we'll be able to have those things natively. There's also things like StoreKit 2 which we're excited to introduce in Ruby.

### Release Date
Hopefully, we'll roll out Ruby 2.0 alongside the public release of iOS 15. It could potentially be later however. Expect Ruby 2.0 this fall.

### Conclusion
We hope you're excited for Ruby 2.0! Join the Public TestFlight [here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/EcbyojPY). The TestFlight works for iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, and Apple Watch. The Mac app is not available for Testing - as TestFlight for Mac doesn't exist *yet*. It will be available in the fall - which we're also excited to use.
