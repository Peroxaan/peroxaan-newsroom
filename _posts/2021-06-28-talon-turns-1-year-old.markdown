### Introduction
It's been 1 year since Talon initially launched on the iOS App Store, which is quite honestly crazy to think about. Time flies, I guess? Since last year, we've expanded to Android, macOS, and Windows. Between all platforms, we've achieved 10K downloads altogether, with around 7.5K on iOS/macOS and 2.5K on Android. It's incredible to see how many people enjoy what we've made.

### What's next?
Well, we're working on plenty of new features, including IFTTT webhook support, Discord Embeds (maybe), and more. These features should be introduced in v1.3 - coming this Summer. In addition to all of these features, we've just started development on our own Link Shortening service - which will be hosted at talon.link. talon.link will be available to Talon Pro customers, and will replace the current Link Shortening API we've been using.

### Anything else?
Talon v1.3 is early in planning, and we hope to share more information with you about what will change for all of the platforms Talon is available on. For now, thats all we have to share. Thanks for enjoying Talon, and thanks for being with us on this journey.
