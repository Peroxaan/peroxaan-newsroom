### Introduction
Hola everyone! It's been a while since you've heard from us. Early last year, we announced the name Azurite, then later in the summer, we announced what the app would be. 
I know its been over a year since we've spoke about it (aside from one hint in August), but today - we will be unveiling more information on the project, including when you'll be able to use it. 

### What is Azurite?
As we [announced](https://twitter.com/Peroxaan/status/1282162813570551810?s=20) in Summer 2020, Azurite is built in SwiftUI, and will be an app that allows you to keep up with various stocks, and crypto - with a clean interface.
You'll also be able to check news related to stocks, and the stock market as a whole, in the app.

### Where will I be able to use Azurite?
At first, we will be building an iOS app for iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch - but hope to expand to more platforms in the future. We'll let you know when we have more information on that!

### Azurite beta!?
I'm glad you asked! If you're part of our Insider program (which is not currently accepting new users) - you'll get an Azurite "beta 0" within the next few days, and for everyone else - we plan to launch a public Azurite beta by the end of the year. Stay tuned!

### Where can I see Azurite?
The first two screenshots of the updated version of Azurite for iOS can be viewed on this Tweet (if you're reading this within ~5 mins of it being tweeted, you wont have the link yet) ðŸ˜„

### What's next?
We plan to launch Azurite on the iOS App Store sometime next year, likely around the Summer/Fall timeframe. Besides that though, we look forward to giving everyone access to Azurite in a public beta form later this year! 
Thanks for supporting us along the way <3
