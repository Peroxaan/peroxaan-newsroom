Just a few days ago, Apple featured Talon, the first app released by Peroxaan Studios - in their 'Peek Performance' event on March 8th.

### Details

It was quite the surprise to the team, but it was honestly an incredible accomplishment - especially considering how prominent the App Icon was, out of the bunch they showed.

This was the first time any Peroxaan app has been featured this prominently, and we hope it won't be the last. Regardless though, being in a keynote with millions of viewers (even if just for a few seconds) was a pretty neat experience.

It was around the 34 minute mark, when they were talking about apps optimized for Apple Silicon Macs. You can see a screenshot [here](https://twitter.com/tme_michael/status/1501292929113014273).

### Final Words

Thank you for supporting us up until now! We have more announcements coming soon, stay tuned.
